        <h3>CIA traid on cybersecurity</h3>
        <p>The CIA triad is a widly used infmation securtiy model that guides orgizantion effors and policies aimed at
          keeping its data secured. it is a three pillar approach with regards to infmration securtiy. its fomred with 3
          main componets: confidentiality, integrity and availabiltiy</p>

        <h3>confidentiality </h3>
        <p> that component is associated with screcy specifically with the use of encrypetion. in this context
          confidentiality means that data is only accessed by authorized persons. information that is kept confidential
          means that is has not been compromised by orther parties; any data that is confidential is not disclosed to
          people who do not need them or if they dont have access to them. ensuring confidentiality means that
          information is organized in terms of the personell who have access to it as weell as the sensitivy of the
          data. breaches of confidentiality often hacking due to practices like hacking or social engineering</p>

        <h3>integrity</h3>
        <p>data intergirty is how much the data hasent been touched or modified during or after it is added to main
          databeases. it is the certentaty that data has not been modifided, either intentional or unintentional. there
          are two points where the integrity could be compromised . the upload or transmission of the data or during the
          storage of the data</p>

        <h3>avaliability</h3>
        <p> this means that people have the autorization to access data when needed for a system to show avalibility it
          needs functioning computer systems, security control and communication channels. system defined as critical
          like power generation, medical equipment or saftey sysyem have much more stricter and exterm requirements to
          gain access. these systems must be defended againsty cyber threats and so must have safeguards agiansts power
          outages bu haveing a backup generator, hardware failures like having backups of the data or a backup server
          and orther eveents that might impact the system avaliability.</p>
