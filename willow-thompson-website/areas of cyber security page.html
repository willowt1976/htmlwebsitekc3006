		<h2>what are the areas of cyber security </h2>
    <p>physical , technical and human are all areas of cyber security and in order to exercise the most effective practive of cyber security all these aspects need to acknowledged and considered 
    <h3>physical</h3>
		<p>this refers to the physical existance of our digital technology. all the devices and the servers that they connect to , this also encompasses the location of the technology , and the security of it. people can gain access to devices and ifrastructer through physical means. for example someone who has stolen a phone or laptop gain the abaility to get access to all the informatio on you phone. devices included in the IoT add ontehr element of risk as the number of devices connect physically increase the more suspectable they are to attacks</p>
      <h3> technical</h3>
        <p>technical cybersecurity are the methords we protect ourself digitally. this includes software like antivirus to the use of compnies and governments using ethical hacking to find vunerablties to protect thier data.for orgisnations they may use red team assessments to find gaps in thier security or to form cyber security stratigies. teachnical cyber security teams look at threats and vulnerabilties and work to mitigate them.  </p>

       <h3>Human</h3>
        <p>human cyber security is how humans can impact security leves.individuals contorl a large part of how secure thier devices are.humans devlope sofware and include cyber secuity whereever possable. indentifiying how people can develope or hinder cyber security is crucle in understanding the strenghts and weaknesses of thier security.red team assessments often use ethical social enginerrs toassess how suseptible emplyess are to phising and scams. raising awarness for cyber security is also important as people who have a strong understanding of how and why we practice good cyber security are far less likly to fall victim</p>
        <h3>red team aeessments</h3>
        <p>red team assessments aredone by cyber security professinals to test security of networks and systems.this is done by simulation attcks on orgisnations to find vulnerabilties and then to reprot back thier findings and recommendations. within these assessments are tests on the physical, human and technical side of cyber security practices of an orgisnation. some indiduals will attempt to ethically and legally penatrate networks to test for any weaknesses. some indivuals will attmpt to use techniquies like phishing, impersonation sorces or people to atttempt to gain access from employess. some people will attempt to circumnavigate security guards or receptionists to try and gain physical access to hardware like using a fake badge. these teams are important as they assess all areas of cyber secuyiry then identifiy the weakneeses for improvment.</p>
        <h3>awareness raising</h3>
        <p>cyber security awareness raising come in different forms and ist curcle on both individuals and in larger communities. today awareness raising is boring and ineffective with many dull courses and presentations rarely being impactful enough to stay in peoples mind.</p>
